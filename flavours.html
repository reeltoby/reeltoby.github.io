When you drink coffee, your taste buds are going to pick up on many different flavours that you can learn to understand, analyse and decipher. It may be hard at first but, with a bit of practice, you can train yourself to identify each individual flavour. The aim is to fine-tune your own preferences to make sure that you always choose the coffee that suits you best. But as we’ve already seen, attempting to cover every possible aromatic subtlety in one article would be an impossible task. That’s why we’re going to start you off with some introductory tips :-)</p>
